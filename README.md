# QPA

This project requires a `google-services.json` file for Firebase and Google services configuration.

## Getting Started

1. Obtain your own Firebase project configuration from the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `app/` directory of this project.
3. The file is ignored by Git, so you must provide it yourself when setting up the project.


The Google Maps API key is read from this file as well, so make sure the key is correctly configured in your Firebase project.
